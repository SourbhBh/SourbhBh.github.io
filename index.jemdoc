== About Me
I am a PhD candidate in the  [https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ *Electrical and Computer Engineering*] at [https://www.cornell.edu *Cornell University*], jointly advised by [https://people.ece.cornell.edu/wagner/ *Aaron Wagner*] and [https://people.ece.cornell.edu/acharya/ *Jayadev Acharya*]. \n My research focuses broadly on problems in information theory and machine learning. Recently I have been exploring the intersection of causality and machine learning, specifically causal discovery and causal representation learning. 

Before coming to Cornell, I graduated with a BTech and MTech in [https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in *Electrical Engineering*] from [https://www.iitm.ac.in *Indian Institute of Technology, Madras*] and was fortunate to be advised by [https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~andrew *Andrew Thangaraj*].
