<h2>Locally Recoverable Codes (LRCs) with Availability (Master's Thesis) </h2>
<p><b>Guide :</b> <a href="http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~andrew/"><b>Prof. Andrew Thangaraj</b></a> <br /> <br />
Modern distributed storage systems use erasure codes to protect themselves against server failures or node failures more efficiently and reliably. <br /> Locally Recoverable Codes (LRCs)
are a class of codes that seek to minimize the number of nodes required to repair a failed node. LRCs with <br /> multiple disjoint repair groups find applications in recovering from multiple node failures and 
accessibility of &ldquo;hot&rdquo; data, leading to these codes <br /> being called LRCs with availability. <br /> <br /> My work attempts to construct LRCs with availability that are optimal with respect to distance. 
In addition, I also try to develop upper bounds <br /> for various scenarios concerning LRCs with availability and seek to construct codes that meet these bounds. Our key contributions
so far include
<br /> showing optimality of a known construction for special cases, deriving distance upper bounds for LRCs with unequal locality and availability and <br /> an explicit optimal parity-check matrix construction
for LRCs with information locality and availability.

<h2>Upper Bounds for Gaussian MIMO Z Channels and Weighted Sum-rate Maximization for Gaussian MIMO MAC</h2>
<p><b>Guide :</b> <a href="http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~skrishna/"><b>Prof. Srikrishna Bhashyam</b></a> <br /> <br />
I worked with Prof. Srikrishna Bhashyam on two problems in network information theory. The first problem was to find optimal 
covariance <br /> matrices that maximize the weighted sum-rate for the Gaussian MIMO Multiple Access Channel. For maximizing the sum-rate an elegant <br /> water-filling 
algorithm is given <a href="http://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~weiyu/01262622.pdf">here</a>. Our approach was to extend these ideas and exploit geometric properties of the existing algorithm 
to <br /> find a simple waterfilling algorithm that finds covariance matrices which maximize the weighted sum-rate. <br /> The second problem that I worked on was related to Gaussian MIMO Z Channels or the one-sided interference channel. An upper bound <br /> on the sum-rate of the Gaussian MIMO Z Channel was proposed by <a href="ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/18/4418455/04418479.pdf">Jafar and Shamai</a>. <a href="http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~skrishna/papers/tcom15.pdf">Prasad et al</a> proposed a new upper bound based on <br /> reducing the interference at one of the receivers. Numerically, this was shown to be tighter than the previous upper bound. My work focused <br /> on obtaining an analytical proof of the tightness. We showed the equivalence of this problem to a simple comparison of determinants of two <br /> matrices using convex optimization techniques.</p>
<h2>Downlink Communication System for IITMSAT</h2>
<p><b>Guide :</b> <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in/info/fac/davidk"><b>Prof. David Koilpillai</b></a> <br /> <br />
<a href="http://iitmsat.weebly.com/">IITMSAT</a> is the nanosatellite initiative of IIT Madras whose primary mission is to study the precipitation of high-energy charged particles <br /> (protons and electrons) from Van Allen belts. IITMSAT is scheduled to be launched in early 2017. <br /><br /> 
I was a part of the communication subsystem as a sophomore. From a communications perspective, IITMSAT has a distinctly high downlink <br /> data rate requirement of about 1 Mb per day which no nanosatellite has attempted previously. In addition, due to the satellite being launched <br /> in a Low-Earth orbit (LEO), the ground station at IIT Madras has a pass time of approximately 20 minutes per day, thus necessitating the full <br /> utilization of the pass, including lowe elevation angles where SNR is quite poor. Mitigating these challenges required our subsystem to choose <br /> novel approaches like using a Software-Defined Radio (Perseus) based receiver and implementing novel receiver algorithms using GNURadio.<br /> 
Our downlink system design was accepted for publication at IconSpace, 2015. <b>Refer</b> <a href="/publications.html">Publication 3</a> <br />
I also implemented a hard-decision Viterbi decoder for the rate half convolutional code in GNURadio and an interface between GNURadio and <br />
the SDR, Perseus Radio. In a team of two, I worked on developing the packet protocol, inspired from ECSS and CCSDS standards. On the system <br /> 
level, I initiated the Concept of Operations (operational description of the satellite's functions) in a team of three. Our work on the packet protocol <br /> 
and Concept of Operations was presented at SmallSat, 2016. <b>Refer</b> <a href="/publications.html">Publication 2</a></p>

<h2>Capacity Upper Bounds for the Symmetric Diamond Relay Network</h2>
<p><b>Course :</b> <a href="http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~krishnaj/EE6112.htm"><b>Topics in Random Processes and Concentrations</b></a>, <b>Instructor :</b> <a href="http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~krishnaj/"><b>Prof. Krishna Jagannathan</b></a> <br /> <br />
In this course project, we were required to come up with novel applications of martingales or concentration inequalities in any area of our choice. <br />
Recently, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08540">Wu-Ozgur-Lie</a> use the generalized blowing-up lemma and probabilistic geometric properties of typical sets to show looseness of the <br />
cut-set capacity upper bound for the symmetric primitive relay channel. Using similar ideas, I derived tighter upper bounds on the capacity of the <br />
symmetric diamond channel. Extensions of these upper bounds in the case of Gaussian and parallel binary symmetric channels is ongoing. <br />

<h2>Poisson Point Processes (PPP) versus Hexagonal Grid Models for Downlink Cellular Networks</h2>
<p><b>Course :</b> Wireless and Cellular Communications, <b>Instructor :</b> <a href="http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~giri/"><b>Prof. K. Giridhar</b></a> <br /> <br />
In a team of three students, I reviewed the seminal work of <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6042301/">Andrews-Dhillon-Ganti</a> that pioneered the usage of stochastic geometry in modelling <br /> 
cellular networks and made analysis of cellular networks more tractable without compromising on accuracy of the model. We carried out <br /> 
simulations demonstrating an improvement of PPP models over hexagonal grid models in terms of coverage probability. One of the observations <br /> 
of the paper was that under frequeny-reuse one-third, converage probability performance is not accurate because of the way frequencies are <br />
assigned. We implemented and simulated a Bayesian-like method to increase coverage probability performance. However, tractable analytical  <br />
expressions could not be obtained. A presentation of our work can be found <a href="http://sourbhbh.github.io/Wirelessppt.pdf"><b>here</b></a>.</p>
