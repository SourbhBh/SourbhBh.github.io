<h2>Locally Recoverable Codes (LRCs) with Availability (Master's Thesis) </h2>
<p><b>Guide :</b> <a href="http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~andrew/"><b>Prof. Andrew Thangaraj</b></a> <br /> <br />
Modern distributed storage systems use erasure codes to protect themselves against server failures or node failures more efficiently and reliably. <br /> Locally Recoverable Codes (LRCs)
are a class of codes that seek to minimize the number of nodes required to repair a failed node. LRCs with <br /> multiple disjoint repair groups find applications in recovering from multiple node failures and 
accessibility of &ldquo;hot&rdquo; data, leading to these codes <br /> being called LRCs with availability. <br /> <br /> My work attempts to construct LRCs with availability that are optimal with respect to distance. 
In addition, I also try to develop upper bounds <br /> for various scenarios concerning LRCs with availability and seek to construct codes that meet these bounds. Our key contributions
so far include
<br /> showing optimality of a known construction for special cases, deriving distance upper bounds for LRCs with unequal locality and availability and <br /> an explicit optimal parity-check matrix construction
for LRCs with information locality and availability.

<h2>Upper Bounds for Gaussian MIMO Z Channels and Weighted Sum-rate Maximization for Gaussian MIMO MAC</h2>
<p><b>Guide :</b> <a href="http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~skrishna/"><b>Prof. Srikrishna Bhashyam</b></a> <br /> <br />
I worked with Prof. Srikrishna Bhashyam on two problems in network information theory. The first problem was to find optimal 
covariance <br /> matrices that maximize the weighted sum-rate for the Gaussian MIMO Multiple Access Channel. For maximizing the sum-rate an elegant <br /> water-filling 
algorithm is given <a href="http://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~weiyu/01262622.pdf">here</a>. Our approach was to extend these ideas and exploit geometric properties of the existing algorithm 
to <br /> find a simple waterfilling algorithm that finds covariance matrices which maximize the weighted sum-rate. <br /> The second problem that I worked on was related to Gaussian MIMO Z Channels or the one-sided interference channel. An upper bound <br /> on the sum-rate of the Gaussian MIMO Z Channel was proposed by <a href="ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/18/4418455/04418479.pdf">Jafar and Shamai</a>. <a href="http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~skrishna/papers/tcom15.pdf">Prasad et al</a> proposed a new upper bound based on <br /> reducing the interference at one of the receivers. Numerically, this was shown to be tighter than the previous upper bound. My work focused <br /> on obtaining an analytical proof of the tightness. We showed the equivalence of this problem to a simple comparison of determinants of two <br /> matrices using convex optimization techniques.</p>
